            <p><a class="date">12-04-2024</a><br><br>This transition into Winter has thankfully been a lot lighter than earlier this Fall. I feel myself stepping out of my own way which reminds me that even the emotions we can’t always identify are moving through their own ebbs and flows.<br><br>This Fall I used the word ‘zombie’ a lot when friends asked how I was feeling. It's strange because it was also right when MYSTERYS?GNAL 1.0 was finally ready to launch. This project I'd spent so many hours on and up until October- only existed on my computer.<br><br> Despite the timing, it has been such a satisfying experience participating + interacting with the indie web after years of lurking. I’ve been working on the first official sub-project which is a mutual aid resource zine for prisoners and that should be ready sometime next month. More info to come!!</p>
